	abstract = {This work presents a weighted ensemble of supervised learning models for estimating the days of the year where compliance with the Adaptive Model of thermal comfort is exceeded. The ensemble combines several gradient boosting on decision tree algorithms and Bayesian logistic regression. In a presented case study, the model is trained on three summers of hourly weather data and indoor air temperature data of a south-facing, naturally-ventilated office in Vancouver, Canada. The model is then used to predict thermal comfort exceedance under a possible climate change scenario. It is found that the ensemble outperforms its individual models in terms of accuracy, precision, and similar metrics. In eight of nine trials using the ensemble to re-assess known history, the ensemble predicts total comfort-exceeding days within a margin of one day. Under the RCP 8.5 global climate change scenario, the model predicts annual comfort-exceeding days will double before the 2050s, by that point exceeding current local thermal comfort compliance guidelines. Future applications of the presented methodology may assist other areas of data-driven forecasting, such as peak energy demand prediction. It may also assist analysis of emerging space cooling solutions such as radiant cooling of free-running buildings.},

	abstract = {An important and under-quantified facet of the risks associated with human-induced climate change emerges through extreme weather. In this paper, we present an initial attempt to quantify recent costs related to extreme weather due to human interference in the climate system, focusing on economic costs arising from droughts and floods in New Zealand during the decade 2007–2017. We calculate these using previously collected information about the damages and losses associated with past floods and droughts, and estimates of the “fraction of attributable risk” that characterizes each event. The estimates we obtain are not comprehensive, and almost certainly represent an underestimate of the full economic costs of climate change, notably chronic costs associated with long-term trends. However, the paper shows the potential for developing a new stream of information that is relevant to a range of stakeholders and research communities, especially those with an interest in the aggregation of the costs of climate change or the identification of specific costs associated with potential liability.},

	abstract = {Hurricane Harvey is one of the costliest tropical cyclones in history. In this paper, we use a probabilistic event attribution framework to estimate the costs associated with Hurricane Harvey that are attributable to anthropogenic influence on the climate system. Results indicate that the “fraction of attributable risk” for the rainfall from Harvey was likely about at least a third with a preferable/best estimate of three quarters. With an average estimate of damages from Harvey assessed at about US\$90bn, applying this fraction gives a best estimate of US\$67bn, with a likely lower bound of at least US\$30bn, of these damages that are attributable to the human influence on climate. This “bottom-up” event-based estimate of climate change damages contrasts sharply with the more “top-down” approach using integrated assessment models (IAMs) or global macroeconometric estimates: one IAM estimates annual climate change damages in the USA to be in the region of US\$21.3bn. While the two approaches are not easily comparable, it is noteworthy that our “bottom-up” results estimate that one single extreme weather event contributes more to climate change damages in the USA than an entire year by the “top-down” method. Given that the “top-down” approach, at best, parameterizes but does not resolve the effects of extreme weather events, our findings suggest that the “bottom-up” approach is a useful avenue to pursue in future attempts to refine estimates of climate change damages.},

	abstract = {Can thermal retrofit measures also enhance summer heat resilience and climate justice? Two common building types of multifamily dwellings in Central Europe are investigated: the ‘Gründerzeithaus’ and post-war large-panel construction along with their different inhabitant demographics. Thermal simulations and demographic surveys were undertaken for dwellings in both building types to evaluate the effectiveness of retrofit measures in reducing winter heat demand and to understand the impacts on summer overheating. Results indicate that standard retrofitting measures can reduce the overheating risks. The high summer temperatures on the top floor can be significantly lowered to values comparable with the ground floor. The remaining overheating in highly exposed rooms is reduced by additional selective adaptation measures. Adaptation requires more than technical interventions. Demographic surveys conducted for both building types show that different social groups are affected. The economics of retrofit requires policy clarity to avoid placing additional burdens on economically disadvantaged people. Inhabitants’ active involvement in night-time ventilation are vital for avoiding overheating. Appropriate affordances and a clear guidance for manual window opening/closing can reduce overheating. However, inhabitants who are unable to act (e.g. the elderly, immobile or those with chronic diseases) will be increasingly vulnerable and disadvantaged by increased exposure to overheating.

 

Practice relevance
The existing approaches for reducing heating demand and their impacts on overheating are examined for two common building types in Central Europe: the Gründerzeithaus and post-war large-panel multifamily housing. The evidence of physical effects and social interdependencies provides a basis both for decision-makers to select suitable measures, and for inhabitants to apply appropriate behavioural practices. Thermal retrofitting strategies for reducing winter heating demand can lead to enhanced resilience to hot summer weather, but also entail inhabitants’ active involvement. Additional technical measures are needed to ensure reduced levels of overheating. Inhabitants’ practices have a significant influence on resilience and the reduction of overheating. Therefore, technical interventions must be accompanied by clear strategies to empower inhabitants to control internal temperatures using natural ventilation. Elderly or ill inhabitants may not be able to perform these practices and, therefore, remain vulnerable. Increased rents caused by retrofits may displace socially disadvantaged inhabitants.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a computational framework for the analysis and optimization of energy systems in neighborhoods and city districts. The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50\% to 80\% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100\% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45\% to 60\% in emissions and from 25\% to 50\% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14\% and 44\% higher than today. For an economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23\% in emissions, 36\% in primary energy and 11\% in costs. We identified close to 15\% in emissions and 20\% in primary energy savings with variable costs between −2\% and 23\% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4\% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts.},

The focus lies on determining the spatiotemporal variability of energy services in both standing and future buildings in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. This detailed characterization facilitates the assessment of potential energy efficiency measures at the neighborhood and city district scales. In a novel approach we integrated existing methods in urban and energy planning domains such as spatial analysis, dynamic building energy modeling and energy mapping to provide a comprehensive, multi-scale and multi-dimensional model of analysis. The model is part of a geographic information system (GIS), which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. The model is validated against measured data and a peer model for a city district in Switzerland. In this context, we present practical applications in the analysis of energy efficiency measures in buildings and urban zoning.

This paper describes the integration of future UK climate scenarios into the widely used Typical Meteorological Year (TMY2) and EnergyPlus/ESP-r Weather (EPW) file formats and demonstrates the importance of climate change analysis through a case study example. The ‘morphing’ methodology published by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) is utilised as a baseline for transforming current CIBSE Test Reference Years (TRY) and Design Summer Years (DSY) into climate change weather years. A tool is presented that allows generation of TMY2/EPW files from this ‘morphed’ data and addresses the requirements related to solar irradiation, temperature, humidity and daylighting beyond the parameters provided by CIBSE weather years. Simulations of a case study building highlight the potential impact of climate change on future summer overheating hours inside naturally ventilated buildings.},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Key questions that scientists and engineers typically want to address can be formulated in terms of predictive science. Questions such as: “How well does my computational model represent reality?”, “What are the most important parameters in the problem?”, and “What is the best next experiment to perform?” are fundamental in solving scientiﬁc problems. mystic is a framework for massively-parallel optimization and rigorous sensitivity analysis that enables these motivating questions to be addressed quantitatively as global optimization problems. Often realistic physics, engineering, and materials models may have hundreds of input parameters, hundreds of constraints, and may require execution times of seconds or longer. In more extreme cases, realistic models may be multi-scale, and require the use of high-performance computing clusters for their evaluation. Predictive calculations, formulated as a global optimization over a potential surface in design parameter space, may require an already prohibitively large simulation to be performed hundreds, if not thousands, of times. The need to prepare, schedule, and monitor thousands of model evaluations, and dynamically explore and analyze results, is a challenging problem that requires a software infrastructure capable of distributing and managing computations on large-scale heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we present the design behind an optimization framework, and also a framework for heterogeneous computing, that when utilized together, can make computationally intractable sensitivity and optimization problems much more tractable. The optimization framework provides global search algorithms that have been extended to parallel, where evaluations of the model can be distributed to appropriate large-scale resources, while the optimizer centrally manages their interactions and navigates the objective function. New methods have been developed for imposing and solving constraints that aid in reducing the size and complexity of the optimization problem. Additionally, new algorithms have been developed that launch multiple optimizers in parallel, thus allowing highly efﬁcient local search algorithms to provide fast global optimization. In this way, parallelism in optimization also can allow us to not only ﬁnd global minima, but to simultaneously ﬁnd all local minima and transition points -- thus providing a much more efﬁcient means of mapping out a potential energy surface.},

Using TRNSYS, the proposed systems were modeled for three housing types – a 1980’s house, an energy efficient house and a future “Net Zero Ready” house in the Toronto region with a 210 m2 heated floor area. Through optimisation and a 20 year life cycle analysis, it was found that a standard air source heat pump system is the most economically viable for a 1980’s and energy efficient house. A ground source heat pump system is the most economically viable for a future “Net Zero Ready” house. The effect of natural gas pricing on system selection was also investigated.},

	abstract = {Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems contribute significantly to operational energy and CO2e emissions during the service life of office buildings. Over the last decade, stringent energy codes have enabled the introduction of new HVAC technologies to reduce operational CO2e emissions. However, life cycle carbon emissions of buildings are odivided into operational carbon (OC) and embodied carbon (EC). Operational carbon are the CO2e emissions generated from the burning of fossil fuels used to heat, cool and power the building space during its service life, while EC encompasses the CO2e emissions equivalent to producing, procuring, installing, mantaining, repairing and disposing of the materials and components that make up the building. Over the last decade, broad efforts have improved the understanding of the role that HVAC system selection play in overall OC, nevertheless, EC of HVAC has remained unexamined This paper aims to identify typical HVAC systems used in office building design in Washington State and explore the effects of current practice on total energy use, operational and embodied CO2e. The study sample is composed of twenty office buildings in Washington State registered under the LEED v3 2009 version, from which 15 have obtained LEED certification in the last two years. The projects are registered under the New Construction (NC), Core and Shell (CS), Existing Buildings and Operation and Maintenance (EB:OM) and Commercial Interiors (CI) products and comply with the requirements established in the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 energy standard. The results show that typical HVAC system selection is often a combination of different technologies for ventilation, heating and cooling, and that in general: smaller buildings tend to incorporate high efficiency packaged units while medium and large size buildings typically rely on High Performance Variable Air Volume (HPVAV) systems or hydronic systems such as chilled beams and water source heat pumps (WSHP). The results also indicate that data available through the LEED v3 2009 documentation system on embodied carbon of the mechanical systems is limited and that simplified methods to assess embodied carbon of HVAC are needed in order to integrate EC into whole life assessment of Mechanical Systems.},

	abstract = {A consensus is forming among experts that the best way to achieve emissions’ reduction in the near and mid-term is increasing the demand-side energy efficiency—this is especially true in developing countries where the potential for demand reduction is significant and achievable at relatively lower cost. Enhanced energy efficiency also reduces energy costs and can result in a financial benefit to end-users, if the life-cycle value of energy savings offsets the upfront cost of implementing the measure. At the same time, reducing energy demand translates into lower pull for fossil fuel import and supply/distribution capacity expansion. An ideal candidate for the implementation of demand-side energy efficiency measures is the building sector, since it contributes to a large extent to the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted worldwide. In most developing countries, the contribution of the building sector to the total national GHG emissions is significantly higher than the worldwide average. This is in part due to the lower level of industrial activity. Other drivers of the high emissions of the building sector are the inefficiency of the envelope and technical systems of the existing buildings, as well as harsh climatic conditions requiring the use of energy intensive air-conditioning equipment. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) currently have the highest ecological footprint per capita in the world. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the focus of this study, can be expected to have a footprint that is even higher, being the largest economy and the major oil producer among the seven Emirates. In addition to the environmental consequences of unrestrained energy consumption, the fact that energy prices are heavily subsidized in  Abu Dhabi results in a significant financial burden for the government. In the UAE and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the air-conditioning load in buildings is the ideal target for  demand-side management because it constitutes more than 60\% of the total energy consumption. However, many sources of uncertainty still remain. How should we assess the life-cycle cost/benefit of candidate demand-side interventions? Which ones to choose in order to maximize national utility? This study will start to answer those questions by using a detailed engineering model of a typical Abu Dhabi building as specified by the Emirate’s Urban Planning Council. Using the model building as a baseline, we then proceed to evaluate the energy impact of different retrofits through numerical simulation. We present a novel Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) for the Emirate of  Abu Dhabi focusing exclusively on demand-side measures having an impact on the  air-conditioning load. A surprising number of the abatement levers analyzed in this study exhibit a positive net present value (NPV), if the cost-reflective price of electricity is used for the life-cycle assessment.},

The economics of climate action needs to be at the forefront of climate dialogue to prioritize investments among competing mitigation measures. A marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve is an effective visualization of climate action that initiates a technical and economic discussion of the cost-effectiveness and abatement potential of such actions among local leaders, policy makers, and climate experts. More commonly demonstrated for countries, MAC curves need to be developed for cities because of their heterogeneity, which vary in their urban activities, energy supply, infrastructure stock, and commuting patterns. The methodology for constructing bottom-up MAC curves for cities is presented for technologies that offer fuel switching and/or energy efficiencies, while considering technology lifetimes, city-specific electricity and fuel prices, and emission intensities. Resulting MAC curves are unique to every city, and chart the pathway towards low-carbon growth by prioritizing measures based on cost-effectiveness. A case study of Toronto’s climate targets demonstrates the prioritization of select technologies. Leveraging MAC curves to support climate programs enables cities to strategically invest in financing climate action and designing incentives.},
