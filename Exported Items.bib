	abstract = {This paper presents a life cycle cost analysis of several combinations of heat pump systems with renewable sources in the Canadian climate. Using TRNSYS, the proposed systems were modeled for three housing types – a 1980’s house, an energy efficient house and a future “Net Zero Ready” house in the Toronto region with a 210 m2 heated floor area. Through optimisation and a 20 year life cycle analysis, it was found that a standard air source heat pump system is the most economically viable for a 1980’s and energy efficient house. A ground source heat pump system is the most economically viable for a future “Net Zero Ready” house. The effect of natural gas pricing on system selection was also investigated.},
